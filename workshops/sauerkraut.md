# Sauerkraut

## Before the Workshop

### Purchase Special Ingredients/Materials

The following can be somewhat hard to find in your supermarket. Allow 1.5 week shipping lead time if ordering online.

* [1.5L Jar](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B00166QRN6)
  * Fido jars with a rubber gasket/seal are ideal because it keeps in a layer of carbon dioxide (byproduct of fermentation) which prevents surface mold
* Unrefined sea salt **WITHOUT iodine/Jod**
  * You can buy this at your standard supermarket. Simply wanted to highlight that this is different from your standard salt which contains iodine
  * Iodine will inhibit the fermentation process



**Purchase the remaining fresh ingredients listed in [the Sauerkraut recipe](../recipes/sauerkraut.md#ingredients) shortly before the workshop.**



### Necessary Kitchen Tools

You'll need some kitchen tools available to you:

* A scale (or imperial measuring cups)
* One large bowl
* Cutting board and knife
