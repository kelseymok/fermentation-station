## Prepare for the workshop

### Purchase Special Ingredients/Materials

Kimchi does require a few special ingredients to be bought ahead of time (give it a 1.5 week lead time for shipping):

* [Gochugaru](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B017GFSFEY)
  * This ingredient MAKES Kimchi and cannot be substituted
* [1.5L Jar](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B00166QRN6)
  * Fido jars with a rubber gasket/seal are ideal because it keeps in a layer of carbon dioxide (byproduct of fermentation) which prevents surface mold
* [Glutinous Rice Flour](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B003U2Q0OK)
* Unrefined sea salt **WITHOUT iodine/Jod**
  * You can buy this at your standard supermarket. Simply wanted to highlight that this is different from your standard salt which contains iodine
  * Iodine will inhibit the fermentation process



**Purchase the remaining fresh ingredients listed in [the Kimchi recipe](../recipes/kimchi.md#ingredients) shortly before the workshop.**



### Necessary Kitchen Tools

You'll need some kitchen tools available to you:

* A scale (or imperial measuring cups)
