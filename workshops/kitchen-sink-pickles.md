# "Kitchen Sink" Pickles

Have a variety of vegetables in your fridge that you don't know what to do with? Rescue them using the age old technique of lactofermentation! 

We will be following by [basic lactofermented pickles recipe](../recipes/basic-lactofermented-pickles.md)

## Before the Workshop

### Purchase Special Ingredients/Materials

* [1.5L Jar](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B00166QRN6)
  * Fido jars with a rubber gasket/seal are ideal because it keeps in a layer of carbon dioxide (byproduct of fermentation) which prevents surface mold
* Unrefined sea salt **WITHOUT iodine/Jod**
  * You can buy this at your standard supermarket. Simply wanted to highlight that this is different from your standard salt which contains iodine
  * Iodine will inhibit the fermentation process

### Necessary Kitchen Tools

You'll need some kitchen tools available to you:

* A scale (or imperial measuring cups)
* Cutting board and knife



### Identify Vegetables for Fermentation



You can ferment just about everything. For this workshop, I would recommend any combination of vegetables that "have a crunch":

* Cauliflower

* Carrots

* Zucchini/Courgette

* Paprika/Sweet Bell Pepper

* Onion

* Broccoli

* Radish

* Kohlrabi

* Cucumber

  

Get inspired by [these combinations](../recipes/basic-lactofermented-pickles.md#variations).
