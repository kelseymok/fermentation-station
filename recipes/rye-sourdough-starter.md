# Rye Sourdough Starter

## Creating a Sourdough Starter

There are a variety of recipes online to create a Sourdough Starter, if you aren't able to get a Starter from a friend or an online shop. Regardless of the variations, the only two things you'll need are flour and water. I am personally skeptical of recipes that take starter from other ferments, mostly because I believe it has the possibility of having unexpected consequences to the PH and ecosystem necessary for the survival of the sourdough culture.

## Maintaining a Sourdough Starter

Sourdough is a live organism. It requires food and a healthy environment to live in, and therefore must be fed from time to time. Fun fact, "sourdough babysitters" are a thing.

### Materials

* Glass jar with a lid

### Ingredients

* 50g Rye Flour (1150)
* 50g Water (warm)
* 1 tsp of Sourdough Starter

### Instructions

1. Mix the flour, water, and starter in a jar
2. Cover (the lid keeps the top from drying out)
3. If preparing for an immediate bread, let sit out on a warm shelf or on a radiator. Else, place in the fridge (and repeat in a week or two).

### Notes

A successful sourdough culture is the symbiosis of lactobacillus bacteria (responsible for the sour flavour) and wild yeast. If there's a misbalance (for example, not enough lactobacillus), it could lead to your sourdough being a home to mold instead. I have no way to measure this except for experimentation and feeling, but warmer temperatures (for my sourdough culture) seem to result in a higher yeast content and longer ferments at a lower temperature seem to result in a more sour flavour.
