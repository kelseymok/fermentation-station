# Sauerkraut

## Materials

* 1.5L jar (I use a round Fido jar with a swingtop lid) or a fermentation crock
* [Fermentation weights]([https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07LFZ6W8N/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3LU6HLX23ATW8&dchild=1&keywords=g%C3%A4rgewichte&qid=1586102790&sprefix=endgame%2Caps%2C281&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07LFZ6W8N/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3LU6HLX23ATW8&dchild=1&keywords=g√§rgewichte&qid=1586102790&sprefix=endgame%2Caps%2C281&sr=8-1))

## Ingredients

* 1 head of cabbage
* 2% of weight of cabbage (without core)
* 1 tablespoon Caraway seeds

## Instructions

1. Slice the cabbage into quarters. Cut out the core. 
2. Slice the cabbage in to super small ribbons (.5cm)
3. Add salt and massage for about 20 minutes. The cabbage should shrink and should create plenty of brine.
4. Add caraway seeds
5. Pack into jar, push the cabbage under the resulting brine. Place the fermentation weights on top of the cabbage to keep it under the brine. NOTE: it can be helpful to reserve one or two large leaves to rest on top of the sliced cabbage to help keep the flyaways under control.
6. Let sit on a shelf for 6 weeks, in a dark place (or place a towel over the jar). Check daily that the cabbage is fully covered under brine.

## Note

This can be a powerful ferment. Don't forget to burp your jar every morning and evening. In the early days, it will smell like sulfur (if you don't have a dog to blame, this is your opportunity!). Additionally, don't use jars with flat sides because these don't distribute pressure as well as round jars (you run the risk of creating glass bombs in your kitchen).

People seem to have made sauerkraut without salt or with very little salt. That kind of scares me and I've always had luck with 2% salt. You can try with less, but that's your stomach. :)
