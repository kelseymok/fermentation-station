## Materials

* 1.5L jar
* [Fermentation weights (optional)]([https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07LFZ6W8N/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3LU6HLX23ATW8&dchild=1&keywords=g%C3%A4rgewichte&qid=1586102790&sprefix=endgame%2Caps%2C281&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07LFZ6W8N/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3LU6HLX23ATW8&dchild=1&keywords=g√§rgewichte&qid=1586102790&sprefix=endgame%2Caps%2C281&sr=8-1))

## Ingredients

* 1 head of cabbage
* 2% of weight of cabbage (without core) in salt
* 1-2 tablespoons Caraway seeds (to taste)

## Instructions

1. Slice the cabbage into quarters. Cut out the core. 
2. Slice the cabbage in to super small ribbons (.5cm)
3. Add salt and massage for about 20 minutes. The cabbage should shrink and should create plenty of brine.
4. Add caraway seeds
5. Pack into jar, push the cabbage under the resulting brine. Place the fermentation weights on top of the cabbage to keep it under the brine, if using them; else, just use a clean spoon to push the cabbage under the brine daily. 
6. Let sit in a room temperature shelf for 2 weeks. Burp jar daily for roughly the first 2 weeks until bubbles stop forming. Once the bubbles stop forming, the burping can stop, leave sealed to reduce oxygen in glass unless opening to push cabbage under the brine.
7. Place in a cool dark space for another 2-3 weeks. Avoid opening the jar until the 2-3 weeks is over to prevent the layer of CO2 from escaping (it is keeping the surface mold away). Tthe cabbage might peak above the brine but this is ok.

## Note

* This can be a powerful ferment. Don't forget to burp your jar every morning and evening for the first two weeks. In the early days, it will smell like sulfur (if you don't have a dog to blame, this is your opportunity!). Additionally, don't use jars with flat sides because these don't distribute pressure as well as round jars (you run the risk of creating glass bombs in your kitchen).
* Get creative and try different additions! (just be sure to weight the ingredients and add 2% of salt)
  * carrots, onion, garlic
  * beetroot, apples
