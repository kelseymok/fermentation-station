## Instructions

1. Soak the Soy Beans for 24 hours until there is foam on top

3. Cook for 3 hours (it's a lot faster in a pressure cooker if you have one) until soft and creamy when squeezed.
4. Let cool for 20 minutes
5. Dissolve a small amount (TBD) of spores in 10ml water at 80C to activate, pour over beans and mix well with a sterilized spoon
6. Cover with plastic wrap (see [Natto Dad's](http://www.nattodad.com/2013/05/homemade-natto-using-packaged-natto.html) instructions) and place in fermentation chamber at 42C for 18-22 hours
