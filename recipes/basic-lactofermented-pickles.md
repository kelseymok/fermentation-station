# Basic Lactofermented Pickles


## Materials

* Large jar
* [Fermentation weights](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/PPC4-Masontops-Pickle-Pebbles-Plus/dp/B00V41EZNC/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=g%C3%A4rgewicht&qid=1602403702&sr=8-6&th=1)
* Scale



## Ingredients

* [Vegetables (sliced or whole)](#variations)
* Water
* [Unrefined sea salt](#salt)
* Bay leaf (adds tannins to keep the vegetables crunchy -- grape leaves also work)
* Spices



## Instructions

1. Place your jar on the scale. Tare it.
2. Add the bay leaf, veggies
3. Fill the jar with cool or room temperature water so that the veggies are covered
4. Take note of the weight of veggies, spices, and water, calculate 3% (multiply by 0.03) -- this is your salt weight.
5. Pour out some of the water from your jar into a clean bowl or mug and dissolve the salt (amount = the salt weight above)
6. Add the salt water back into the jar, close the jar, and give it a shake to distribute
7. Place the fermentation weights on top of the vegetables so that none of the vegetables are exposed to air
8. Leave at room temperature, out of direct sunlight. Warmer ambient temperatures result in shorter fermentation times. I tend to declare my lactofermentations done after 2-3 days, max 7 days.



## Notes

### Jar Explosions

Lactoferments are alive and will be producing a fair amount of CO2. If your jars are sealed tightly or with a rubber gasket, don't forget to burp your jars daily or risk jar explosions. When using jars with a rubber gasket, I often like to leave the gasket on so that I can monitor how much CO2 is produced during burping, but for those who prefer a low-maintenance ferment, I suggest removing the gasket completely and just shutting the lid.

### Salt

Certain types of salt can inhibit fermentation, for example: salt with iodine. My go-to is either unrefined himalayan salt or unrefined sea salt.

### Variations

* Cucumbers with hot pepper flakes
* Cucumbers with dill, mustard seeds, and garlic 
* Green string beans with dill mustard seeds, and garlic
* Sliced purple/red onion
* White asparagus (unpeeled) with a couple slices of lemon
* Cauliflower, paprika (sweet peppers), carrots
* Basically any vegetable scraps at any given time
* Jalepe√±os, Kiwifuit, garlic, sweet green pepper (brine = 4-5% salt)
