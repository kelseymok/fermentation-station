### Watching your sugar

It might be a lot of sugar but by the time the ferment is done, the bacteria will have eaten up most of it. You can buy a refractometer to check the sugar levels, or just use your taste buds.

### Bottling

BEWARE that this ferment is extremely strong and could result in bottle explosions and ginger beer (and glass) all over your kitchen. Some people bottle in plastic recycled bottles since it's easier to monitor. I personally prefer small batches and to pour it straight out of the fermentation vessel. There's quite some literature out there about the different types of bottles and the pressure that it can handle.
