# Rye Sourdough Bread

Bread should contain the least amount of ingredients possible. Of course embellishments such as carrots, seeds, and nuts are welcome, but I'm referring to all of those preservatives and emulsifiers. You should only need flour, water, and salt.



## Materials

* Bread Form / Loaf pan (something that can withstand high heat)
* Glass jar with a lid (or a bowl with a lid)



## Preparing the Sponge

### Ingredients

* 100g Rye Flour (type 1150)
* 100g Warm Water
* 1 teaspoon of [Rye starter](./rye-sourdough-starter.md) (from the fridge)



### Instructions

1. In a glass jar, mix the flour, water, and starter
2. Cover and let rise overnight either on a warm shelf or on a warm radiator. It's ready when it has doubled in size.



### Note

If it hasn't doubled in size overnight, it might be the result of a slower sourdough culture. If it hasn't doubled in size by the second day, likely the sourdough culture is too weak, does not have enough food, or there is too much lactobacillus for the yeast to survive. I repeat the above with a spoon from this batch and try to put it in a warmer location. I've had good luck with putting it directly on a pretty warm radiator (but don't boil your starter).



## Preparing the Dough

### Ingredients

* 300g Rye Flour (type 1150)
* 300g Wheat Flour (type 550)
* ~480g Warm Water (I never measure this, but I aim for about 90% hydration and a super wet dough). Check out [Bakers Percentages](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/pro/reference/bakers-percentage). 
* 1.5 teaspoons of salt

### Instructions

1. Mix the Rye and Wheat flours together with the salt in a large bowl
2. Add the sourdough from the previous step
3. Slowly add the warm water (100g at a time). Mix with a spoon or your hands (hint: use wet hands) for about 10 minutes. You want a wet dough that you can hold in your hands and is very soft -- not runny batter though. You might not use all of the water. I prefer to make bread that has a high level of hydration, otherwise it’s too dry (or goes stale quickly). Note that because we are using Rye Flour, your dough won't form the gluten structures as well as a dough made from pure type 550 flour. My dough normally seems mixable, less kneadable. **Variations**: Sometimes I add shredded carrots or soaked pumpkin seeds to the dough. Get creative!
4. Prepare the breadform by rubbing butter/oil on the sides. At this point you can add some oats to the breadform itself (using the butter/oil to help it stick).
5. Add the dough to the prepared breadform. You can add oats to the top. Cover with a wet tea towel.
6. Let rise for 4-5 hours, or until doubled/tripled in size (I put this directly on a radiator).
7. Preheat oven to 220C (the top and bottom elements, not with the Fan). Take a sharp knife and slice vertically down the middle of the bread (2cm deep) and immediately add to the oven. 
8. If you have a tray, pour about 200ml water in it to help with the humidity. Else take a spray bottle and spray the bread and the oven.
9. After 15 minutes, lower to 210C, remove the tray of water and briefly let the humidity out by opening the door for about 10 seconds.
10. Bake for 40 minutes or until the bread turns dark (this depends on the strength of your oven).
11. Testing for doneness: remove the bread from the breadform and tap the bottom/sides as if you're looking for a stud in a wall. If it sounds definitely hollow, it's done. Else, there's still too much raw dough and you should put the bread directly back on the rack (without the breadform) and let bake for another 10-15 minutes until the bread sounds hollow.
12. When done, let cool on a rack. Do not slice immediately because you’ll let all of the moisture out.
