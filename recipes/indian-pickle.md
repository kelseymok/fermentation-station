# Indian Pickle
Traditionally, this pickle is made as a sun pickle in India, requiring quite some sunlight and heat. This is a temperate-climate-compatible recipe that uses lactofermentation to achieve the "pickle" or "preserve".


## Materials
* [1 L jar](https://github.com/kelseymok/fermentation-station/blob/master/README.md#an-opinion-about-jars)
* Mortar/Pestle or spice grinder


## Ingredients

* 700g of cubed fruit/veg pieces (pineapple, mango, lemon, cauliflower/carrots/tomatoes)
* 1 tablespoon black mustard seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon black Nigella seeds (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon methi/fenugreek seeds
* 2 tablespoons red chili powder* (or Cayenne)
* 1 tablespoon paprika powder*
* 14g salt (calculation: 2% * 700g cubed fruit/veg pieces)
* 4 garlic cloves (crushed/minced)
* 3 tablespoons sunflower oil



### NOTE 

\* 2 tablespoons of red chili powder + 1 tablespoon of paprika powder results in a spicy but tolerable heat. If you want in-your-face spicy, use 3 tablespoons of red chili powder and 0 tablespoons of paprika powder. If you don't like spice, you can try Kashmiri Red Chili Powder.

Some of these ingredients are hard to find. I'd recommend going to your local Indian supermarket. Else, try [Jamoona](https://www.jamoona.com/).



## Instructions

1. Clean your jars (make sure there's no soap residue). Sterilise by boiling water and pouring into the jar; similarly sterilise the lid by placing the lid in a bowl and pouring boiling water over it. Let rest for a few minutes.
3. Dry roast methi/fenugreek seeds, nigella seelds, and mustard seeds in a small pan on low heat until deep golden and aromatic.
4. Grind/blend fenugreek, mustard, nigella seeds  into a powder (e.g. with a mortar/pestle). 
6. Chop fruit/veg into small cubes with 1cm edges.
7. Add chili powder, methi/fenugreek/nigella/mustard powder, salt, and garlic to a bowl. Mix well.
8. Add oil. Mix again.
9. Add mixture to jar and cover with lid.
10. Ferment at room temperature, away from direct sunlight for 2 weeks. During the two weeks, stir the mixture daily with a clean spoon - this prevents yeast/mold from blooming on the surface until the fermentation creates a lower pH that prevents this type of bloom. If a small yeast/mold bloom does occur, simply remove it (+1 cm deep) and with a clean spoon, give it a stir. This doesn't happen all the time with wild fermentation, but it's also not uncommon.
11. Store in the fridge or a cool cellar. Mine has so far kept for several months in the cellar (~17C).
