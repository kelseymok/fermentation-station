# Indian Pickle



## Ingredients

* 700g of cubed fruit/veg pieces (pineapple, mango, cauliflower/carrots/tomatoes)
* 1 tablespoon black mustard seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon black Nigella seeds (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon methi/fenugreek seeds
* 2 tablespoons red chili powder* 
* 1 tablespoon paprika powder*
* 14g salt (2% * 700g cubed fruit/veg pieces)
* 4 garlic cloves (crushed)
* 3 tablespoon oil



### NOTE 

\* 2 tablespoons of red chili powder + 1 tablespoon of paprika powder results in a spicy but tolerable heat. If you want in-your-face spicy, use 3 tablespoons of red chili powder and 0 tablespoons of paprika powder



Some of these ingredients are hard to find. I'd recommend going to your local Indian supermarket. If not, try [Jamoona](https://www.jamoona.com/).

1. Wash and dry your fruit-veg pieces. 
3. Dry roast methi/fenugreek seeds, nigella seelds, and mustard seeds in a small pan on a low flame until deep golden and aromatic. Transfer to a plate and allow to cool.
