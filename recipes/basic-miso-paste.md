# Basic Miso Paste

Did you know that you can make "Miso" from just about anything? We call this an "amino" paste. 



## Ingredients

* 250g fresh Koji [rice/barley]
* 250g [protein](#protein-variations)
* 25g salt (this is 5% of 250g Koji + 250g protein)



## Instructions

1. Prepare the protein into a paste either by mashing or processing in a food processor
2. Add Koji
3. Add salt
4. Store for 3 months



## Notes

### Protein Preparation

Most of the time, I am fine with simply steaming the protein. Others roast their protein (e.g. vegetables).

### Protein Variations

The key here is that the vegetables must have some measure of starch in them. Alternatively, add some wheat gluten.

* "Boullion" - celery root, leek, parsnip, parsley
* Roasted butternut squash/pumpkin
* Steamed carrots
* Chickpeas (these must be cooked) or other lentils
* Soybeans (this would result in a classic Miso)
* Old sourdough bread (crumbs)
* Beetroot
* Shitake Mushrooms
