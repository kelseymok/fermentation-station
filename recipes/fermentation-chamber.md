## Heating Source

### High Tech: Instant Pot

Apparently on "bread proofing" mode on the [Instant Pot](https://www.amazon.de/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-programmierbarer-Schnellkochtopf/dp/B00OP26T4K), you can choose at what temperature you'd like to incubate your cultures. Don't take my word for it, I don't own one, feel free to do your own research. :) 

### Sort of High Tech: Seedling Heating Mat

The biggest challenge is finding a heating mat with the right amount of power to allow certain temperatures and a mat that didn't already have a temperature regulator in place. [This seedling heating mat](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B001B93ZPG/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&psc=1) had an appropriate amount of wattage (to be confirmed) and was designed to be plugged into a temperature regulator.

### Low Tech: Hot Water Bottles

I started out low tech and bought a 2L hot water bottle. I was able to manage different temperature requirements by varying the starting temperature of the water. For example:

* 1 hot water bottle with 1/2 kettle-hot water, 1/2 room temperature water => 5-6 hours 29-33C
* 1 hot water bottle with kettle-hot water => 45C for at least 3-4 hours
* 2 hot water bottles??

At the end of the day, the hot water bottles and the insulated temperatures were able to sustain the right temperatures for Koji, but it was more difficult for Natto (42C) where the chamber dissipated most of its heat in 4 hours.

### Others

Some people have reported luck with a hairdryer, light bulb in a can, and a space heater, but I'm not sure that I want to risk a fire. [NattoDad](http://www.nattodad.com/2017/07/two-fermemtation-heat-sources-compared.html) uses a portable cooking hob and a temperature regulator in an oven or a ceramic infrared heat emitter.

My Russel Hobbs 25EUR rice cooker can hold 45-50C without the lid and supposedly 65C with the lid.



## Construction

1. Place the heating source at the bottom of the box
2. Place the four jars such that the cooling rack can sit on top of them
3. Place your temperature regulators
