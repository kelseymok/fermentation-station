# Miso

## Materials

* Fermentation container (a jar will work)
* Baking paper

## Ingredients

### Short Term Miso

This miso should be used fairly quickly

* 1 part Koji (weight) : 1 part Soybeans (or other protein) (weight) -- see [soybean hydration ratios](#hydrating-soybeans)
* 5% salt of the total weight (Koji + Soybeans)

### Long Term Miso

This miso can keep for quite a while

* 1 part Koji (weight) : 2 parts Soybeans (or other protein) (weight) -- see [soybean hydration ratios](#hydrating-soybeans)
* 13% salt of the total weight (Koji + Soybeans)

## Instructions

1. [Hydrate soybeans overnight](#how-to-hydrate)
2. Boil for 3 hours in water. Done marker: squish the soybean - it should be creamy and soft
3. Mash with a potato masher
4. Mix with Koji and salt
5. Sterilise your fermentation container (I wipe things down with vodka)
6. Form palm-sized balls of paste. Pack into container. Squish so there are no air pockets
7. Smooth the top surface of your mash, sprinkle with salt
8. Cut a piece of baking paper to a size that covers surface of the mash and place directly on mash (ensure contact)
9. Leave to ferment (Fermentation time = TBD as this project is currently in progress)

## Hydrating Soybeans

The following chart contains the dry to hydrated weight ratios that I've experimented with:

| Dried Soybeans | Hydrated Soybeans |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 200g           | ??                |

### How to hydrate

1. Rinse dry soybeans in water
2. Soak for 24 hours in a ridiculous amount of water (e.g. for 200g I use ~1L of water)
3. Done marker: bubbles sitting on the surface of water
