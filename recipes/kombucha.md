# Kombucha

Source: [Seeds Of Health](http://www.seedsofhealth.co.uk/fermenting/kombucha_howto.shtml)

## Materials

* 1.5L jar (I use a round Fido jar with a swingtop lid) or a fermentation crock

## First Fermentation

### Ingredients

* 1L of water
* 4 teaspoons of Black tea
* 80g sugar
* 100ml Kombucha starter
* 1 Kombucha pellicle/SCOBY (optional, but it helps with more sure acidification)

### Instructions

1. With some amount of the 1L of water (e.g. 200ml), brew some tea (hot water + tea). Let steep for about 10 minutes.
2. Remove tea leaves, dissolve sugar in tea while itâ€™s still warm.
3. Put remaining amount of water (e.g. 800ml) in a jar/fementation vessel. Add sweet tea to the vessel
4. Once cool, add about 100ml Kombucha starter and pellicle/SCOBY
5. Taste in 2-3 days. It should be sweet AND sour.

### Note

**Continuous Brewing.** I tend to only use 800ml of the Kombucha for a second fermentation. The rest, I use as a starter for my next batch. I simply add sweet tea to the original first fermentation vessel.

If it **molds**, it'll mold during the first fermentation. My rule is, if it's any colour except for beige, I throw it out. Check out examples the [Kombucha subreddit]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/search?q=is%20it%20mold&restrict_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/search?q=is it mold&restrict_sr=1)).

## Second Fermentation

### Ingredients

* Brewed Kombucha Tea
* Your favourite flavour (e.g. fruits, coffee, etc)
* Second fermentation vessel (MUST be a vessel that can handle a high amount of pressure, else you risk exploding jars)

### Instructions

1. Add your brewed Kombucha tea to your second fermentation vessel
2. Add "your favourite flavour". Note: you don't need much here, just 2 raspberries or 1/2 of a passionfruit should be more than plenty. The extra sugar will cause extra fermentation and your closed vessel will capture that carbonation. The higher the sugar content, the higher the volatility. 
3. Put in fridge after a couple of days when you are satistfied with the flavour

## Note

Kombucha bottles exploding is a legitimate concern. I tend to do my second fermentation in a mason jar with the gasket removed. I'm not a huge fan of carbonation anyway.
