## Sake Yeast Starter (Shubo)

This is required as we will require yeast to multiply (to allow fermentation to happen) and for lactobacillius to form to ensure a mold-free environment for the sake in the future.

### Materials

* Fermentation container (I use a jar)

### Ingredients

* 80g Koji Rice
* 100g uncooked rice
* 270g Water
* 5g yeast



### Instructions

1. Cook the uncooked rice according to package instructions
2. Once the cooked rice is cooled, mix the remaining ingredients together and place in fermentation container (I use a jar)
3. Store in fridge for 10 days
