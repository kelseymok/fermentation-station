Source: [Polonist](https://www.polonist.com/beet-kvass-zakwas/)

## Materials

* 1.5L jar (I use a round Fido jar with a swingtop lid) or a fermentation crock
* Fermentation weight

## Ingredients

* 500ml of water
* 500g of peeled beets, sliced in thin half-moons
* 3 allspice berries
* 3 black peppercorns
* 3 cloves of garlic, sliced
* 3 bay leaves
* 8g salt

## Instructions

1. Place a couple slice of garlic on the bottom of the jar, add slices of beet so that they lay flat. Rotate the jar so that the cuts of the beet get covered by the next layer (reducing floating beets). 
2. Continue adding beets and layering spices in between (make sure that top most layer is beets so that the spices don't float)
3. Mix 500ml water with 8g salt (roughly a teaspoon) until dissolved. Pour over the beets. Place fermentation weight on top, ensure all beets are covered.
4. Ferment for 1-2 weeks, tasting after the 4th day.
