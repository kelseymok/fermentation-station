# Kimchi

The base recipe is from [Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-kimchi-at-home-189390) and I tend to vary the ingredients based on what's available. The following will fill a 1.5L glass jar.



## Materials

* [1.5L Jar](../README.md#jars)

## Ingredients

* 1 medium Napa Cabbage (Chinakohl, in Germany) ~ 750g

* 75g unrefined salt, **without iodine**. Sea Salt or Himalayan salt works.

* 1 Carrot

* 1 small white radish (daikon) or 1 Kohlrabi

* Water

* 3 cloves of crushed garlic

* 2.5cm of ginger (minced or grated)

* 1 teaspoon of sugar

* 2-3 Tablespoons of Soy Sauce

* 3-5 tablespoons [Gochugaru](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/9144/dp/B017GFSFEY/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3MK97QTU8V407&dchild=1&keywords=gochugaru&qid=1615132346&sprefix=gochugaru%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-5) (to taste)

  * Yes, this might be hard to find and there are recipes with "substitutes" out there, but I find that you can't replace the flavour of Gochugaru. Find it online or head to your local Korean supermarket. If you buy a large pack, store it in the freezer once you've opened it, as it's highly susceptible to mold via humidity, even if it's in a sealed bag.

  

## Instructions

1. Slice the cabbage in quarters lengthwise. Remove the solid root piece. Slice each quarter into three-four pieces.
2. Add the salt and massage for about 10 minutes. You should see the cabbage release some water and shrink. If not, add more salt.
3. Cover with cold water and put a plate over the cabbage to keep the pieces under water. Let rest for 2 hours.
4. Prepare the other vegetables by slicing the carrot and radish into matchsticks.
5. Prepare the Gochugaru paste by combining the garlic, ginger, sugar, soy sauce, and Gochugaru. Mix with the carrot and radish mixture in a large bowl.
6. After two hours of soaking, drain the cabbage. In fistfuls, squeeze the cabbage to remove as much water as you can. Add to the carrots/radish/Gochugaru mixture.
7. Mix the cabbage and the carrots, radish, and Gochugaru by hand (your hands will be red afterwards - use foodsafe gloves if you'd like)
8. Pack into a glass jar or fermentation crock. Let sit on a room-temperature shelf for 3 days or until it is at desired sourness. Every morning/evening, push down the cabbage with a clean spoon (the fermentation will create carbon dioxide which pushes the cabbage up). If there is brine, the cabbage should sit under the brine.
9. After about 3 days (or when preferred sourness is reached), store in the fridge.



## Notes

* If you smell your Kimchi about 1 day into fermentation, it might smell awful, like sulfur. This is normal for cabbage apparently. It should smell delightful by the 3rd day.
