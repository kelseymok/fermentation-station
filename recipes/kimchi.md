# Kimchi

The base recipe adopted from [Maangchi's Traditional Kimchi](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/tongbaechu-kimchi) to be vegan.



## Materials

* [1.5L Jar](../README.md#jars)

## Ingredients

* 1 medium Napa Cabbage (Chinakohl, in Germany) ~ 750g

* 1/2 cup unrefined salt, **without iodine**. Sea Salt or Himalayan salt works. ~75g

* 1 cup water

* 1 tablespoons glutenous rice flour (or regular rice flour)

* 1 tablespoon of sugar

* 1 small onion

* 6 cloves of crushed or minced garlic

* 1 teaspoon minced ginger

* 1/2 cup Soy Sauce

* 1 carrot (chopped into matchsticks ~1/2 cup)

* 1 small white radish (daikon) or 1 Kohlrabi (chopped into matchsticks ~1 cup)

* 3 lengths of spring onions

* 

* 3/4 cup [Gochugaru](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/9144/dp/B017GFSFEY/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3MK97QTU8V407&dchild=1&keywords=gochugaru&qid=1615132346&sprefix=gochugaru%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-5) (to taste)

  * Yes, this might be hard to find and there are recipes with "substitutes" out there, but I find that you can't replace the flavour of Gochugaru. Find it online or head to your local Korean supermarket. If you buy a large pack, store it in the freezer once you've opened it, as it's highly susceptible to mold via humidity, even if it's in a sealed bag.

  

## Instructions

1. Slice the cabbage in quarters lengthwise.
2. Rub salt in between leaves, focusing on the thick areas
3. Let cabbage rest in a bowl for 2 hours.
4. While the cabbage is resting, prepare the porridge by heating the water and glutenous rice flour in a pot. Once paste-like, add sugar. Cook and stir for a minute. Remove from heat and let cool completely.
5. After two hours of soaking, rinse the cabbage under cool water. The cabbage should be sweet and salty. Drain for about 20 minutes. It should be half the original size and floppy.
6. Prepare the other vegetables by slicing the carrot and radish into matchsticks if you haven't done so already.
7. Add minced onion, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and Gochugaru to the cooled porridge to make a paste
8. Add carrots, radish, and green onions
9. With your hands, apply paste between every leaf of the cabbage quarters.
10. Once the the cabbage and paste has been applied, take each cabbage quarter, fold in thirds into a ball and place at the bottom of the jar, layering some of the extra paste between each layer.
11. Let sit at room temperature for 2-3 days. It will become sour.
12. After about 3 days (or when preferred sourness is reached), store in the fridge.



## Notes

* If you smell your Kimchi about 1 day into fermentation, it might smell awful, like sulfur. This is normal for cabbage apparently. It should smell delightful by the 3rd day.
