# Kimchi

The base recipe adopted from [Maangchi's Traditional Kimchi](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/tongbaechu-kimchi) to be vegan.



## Materials

* [1.5L Jar](../README.md#jars)
* Scale or measuring cups



## Special Ingredients

Kimchi does require a few special ingredients to be bought ahead of time (give it a 1.5 week lead time for shipping):

* [Gochugaru](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B017GFSFEY)
* [Glutinous Rice Flour](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B003U2Q0OK)
* Unrefined sea salt **WITHOUT iodine/Jod**
  * You can buy this at your standard supermarket. Simply wanted to highlight that this is different from your standard salt which contains iodine
  * Iodine will inhibit the fermentation process

## Ingredients

* 1 medium-large Napa Cabbage (Chinakohl, in Germany) ~ 1-1.5kg

* 75g (1/2 cup) [unrefined salt](#special-ingredients)

* 240ml (1 cup) water

* 1 tablespoon [glutinous rice flour](#special-ingredients) (or regular rice flour)

* 1 tablespoon of sugar

* 1 small onion

* 6 cloves of garlic

* 1 teaspoon minced/grated ginger

* 120ml (1/2 cup) soy sauce

* 1 carrot

* 1 small white radish (daikon) or 1 Kohlrabi 

* 5 lengths of spring onions

* 80g (3/4 cup) [Gochugaru](#special-ingredients) (to taste)

  * Yes, this might be hard to find and there are recipes with "substitutes" out there, but I find that you can't replace the flavour of Gochugaru. Find it online or head to your local Korean supermarket. If you buy a large pack, store it in the freezer once you've opened it, as it's highly susceptible to mold via humidity, even if it's in a sealed bag.

  

## Instructions

### Prepare the Cabbage (requires 2 hour lead time)

1. Slice the cabbage in quarters lengthwise, removing the core. Then cut these quarters in 3 parts horizontally.

2. Add the salt. With clean hands, mix salt in and gently massage the cabbage until the cabbage is wilted.

3. Let cabbage rest in a bowl (covered with a plate to keep dust out) for 2 hours.

   

### Prepare the porridge (requires some lead time to cool)

1. Heating the water and glutenous rice flour in a pot. Once paste-like, add sugar. Cook and stir for a minute until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool completely at room temperature or in the fridge.

   

### Put it all together

1. Rinse the cabbage under cool water. The cabbage should be  salty. Drain for about 20 minutes. It should be half the original size and floppy.
2. Prepare the other vegetables by slicing the carrot and radish into matchsticks if you haven't done so already.
3. Add minced onion, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and Gochugaru to the cooled porridge to make a paste
4. Add carrots, radish, and sliced green onions
5. Give cabbage a light squeeze to remove excess water and add to vegetable mixture
6. Let sit at room temperature for 2-3 days. It will become sour.
7. After about 3 days (or when preferred sourness is reached), store in the fridge (it will continue to ferment)



## Notes

* The longest I've kept Kimchi in the fridge was 1 year. Am still alive.
