## Materials

* Large jar (Fido, Swingtop, Mason, Weck)
* [Fermentation weights](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/PPC4-Masontops-Pickle-Pebbles-Plus/dp/B00V41EZNC/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=g%C3%A4rgewicht&qid=1602403702&sr=8-6&th=1)
* Scale

## Ingredients

* A **large bowl of hot chilis** (any combination, so long as they’re roughly the same color otherwise the resulting color will be brown) without the stems
* A **large onion** (don’t use too much as sometimes lacto-fermented onions smell a bit fishy) in large chunks
* A **few cloves of garlic**
* Some **fruit of veg to complement** (optional, see [my variations](#variations)) - they MUST be similarly coloured as the chilis or you risk a brown hot sauce
* Unrefined sea salt (must not contain iodione or caking agents) - see [salt](#salt) section



## Instructions

1. Place large jar on scale and add your chilis, onion, garlic, and complementary fruit and veg
2. Add water to only just cover (note that the veg will float and as you will be weighing the veggies down, I recommend less water than too much, so long as the veg are covered with liquid when the weights are on top of them)
3. Take note of the weight. Add 3% of that weight (water + veg) of salt. 
   **Example:** weight of vegetables + water = 500g. 500g * .03 = 15g salt

4. Mix with a spoon until the salt is dissolved
5. Add Fermentation weights so that the veg are completely covered. Cover, burp daily for 1-2 weeks.



## Post Processing

### Chunky Hot Sauce

1. Pull the chilis out into a blender and add a little of the brine until desired consistency is reached
2. Store/age in the fridge (the cold temperature slows down the fermentation)



## Smooth Hot Sauce (and dried fermented chili flakes)

1. Follow the directions of [Chunky Hot Sauce](#chunky-hot-sauce)
2. Strain the hot sauce using a fine mesh sieve (use a spatula to scrape the bottom occasionally to keep the drainage)
3. Store the strained hot sauce in the fridge
4. Dehydrate the strained solids. Store as flakes or grind down to a powder



## Notes

### Jar Explosions

Lactoferments are alive and will be producing a fair amount of CO2. If your jars are sealed tightly or with a rubber gasket, don't forget to burp your jars daily or risk jar explosions. When using jars with a rubber gasket, I often like to leave the gasket on so that I can monitor how much CO2 is produced during burping, but for those who prefer a low-maintenance ferment, I suggest removing the gasket completely and just shutting the lid.

### Salt

Certain types of salt can inhibit fermentation, for example: salt with iodine or caking agent. My go-to is either unrefined himalayan salt or unrefined sea salt.

### Variations

* Red chilis, onion, garlic, mango
* Jalepeños, onion, garlic, kiwis
