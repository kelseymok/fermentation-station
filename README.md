# Fermentation Station

This is a completely unpolished list of opinionated fermentation recipes that friends, family, and colleagues have asked for. Yes, all measurements (except for random spoons of this or that) are in the metric system. No, I will not convert them to "freedom units".

## Jars
I prefer the [1.5L Cylinder Weck jar](https://www.flaschenland.de/Marmeladenglaeser-Einmachglaeser/Glaeser-nach-Typ/WECK-Glaeser/1575ml-WECK-Zylinderglas.html) for all of my fermentation because it releases CO2 when there is enough built up but keeps enough inside to prevent surface mold. Fido jars also work but the seal is tight enough that I worry about explosions. In all cases, round jars are preferred over square jars for pressure distribution reasons (again, to prevent explosions).


## Is it mold?

Remember when embarking on your fermentation journey that you're dealing with live organisms and sometimes you grow dangerous mold instead of good bacteria. When in doubt throw it out. If it looks red, green, orange, blue, and fuzzy, definitely throw it out.  Trust your nose. Your ferments should smell delightful.

Check out the [/r/fermentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/search?q=is%20it%20mold&restrict_sr=1) subreddit for mold examples.

Sometimes it's Kahm's Yeast (and that's fine to eat). Sometimes your ferments get cloudy because of all of the yeast in your ferment (also ok to eat).
